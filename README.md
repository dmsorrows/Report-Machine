# Report-Machine
My Automated Report Template Generator 

The purpose of this machine is to greatly hasten the technical report writing process.  


The technical reports I write on a daily basis are very formulatic and much of the report writing process can be done on "auto-pilot." Meaning, one has to simply go through the motions of pulling and assembling from all of our best-written arguments, resources, and templates. If this is the case, then I believe much of the process can be automated!


The company I work for has an enormous archive of technical reports and resources distributed across thousands of subfolders. To create this machine, I will need to create a database of all of our best templates and text resources. The report machine/form will have drop-down selector options for the report writer to select. Each option will represent a variable that, when submitted to the LOCAL database, will return all of the text templates the writer will need to insert into the report. Essentially, what will be stored into and returned from the database will be long (no more than 300 word) strings. There will be strings for every different chapter of the report.


While I've played around with the HTML and CSS of the report form/machine, I am uncertain as to how to proceed to make this machine function.


I was thinking of having all of the strings/templates on a MySQL database, and on a local WampServer, then use PHP as the language to interact between the HTML page and database. I've briefly read about AJAX queries, but I don't know anything about them. It seems that there are so many avenues and I have no clear idea as to how to build this thing. I just need to be pointed in the right direction. Pls Halp!
